					<h4> Benefits of crowdsourcing human intelligence  </h4>
					<p>As said previously, crowdsourcing involves task sharing between different human participants. It usually take the form of micro-tasks that will be chosen by the participants according to their preference and skills which will allow a better productivity by a fast achievement of micro-tasks and thus of the global task.  
					Crowdsourcing is therefore based on human intelligence. <br>
					Traditional labor processes are generally extremely expensive in terms of money or internal resources and can lead to a waste of time, effectiveness and therefore efficiency. The rise of crowdsourcing and the constant evolution of new technologies could reflect a promising future for a successful business development as it allows addressing those issues.<br>
					</p>
					
					<p>A computer has many different limitations which doesn’t exist in humans such as but not limited to: </P>
					
					<h4>- No intelligence:</h4>  It just follows instructions. If human give wrong instructions, it won’t be able to correct itself. Most computers aren’t built with artificial intelligence which means that they can’t learn by themselves and create new things.

					<h4>- Lack of decision-making:</h4> 
					<p>It doesn’t have the ability to choose a better way to solve problems and offer us recommendations.</p>
					
					<h4>- Computers cannot actively collaborate as a group</h4>
					<p>Moreover, despite daily improvement of algorithms, some tasks are still performed poorly by a computer even though it is very easy for humans. This is why human-based computation is used in different and large scale project. </p>

					<h4><strong>Those projects can be broken down into different types:</strong></h4>

					<h4>Identification marks</h4>
					<p>It is very difficult for computers to perform tasks such as identifying and tagging images or speech’s transcription.
					One worldwide example of human-based computation is the case of ReCAPTCHA. The current login website account page often requires users to enter a verification code, or identify and select an image. Although it is often said that ReCAPTCHA is used to identify humans and beat bots who cannot read those images, there is also another goal behind it: the digitalization of books. Indeed, through mass collaboration (which was, in this case, unknown), books that couldn’t be read or scanned by computers were broken down into words that the crowd would easily recognize and write – a microtasks. The machine would later take the results written and re-assemble it to create a book. Word by word and with the help of many websites and thousands of users, thousands of books from the Internet Archive has been digitalized. To reduce errors, a same word usually needs to be written by different persons. </p>
					<h4>Study and research:</h4>
					<p>Algorithms are not always fully efficient when it comes to translation and science research.
					Duolingo is an example of an application that provides language translation courses as well as documentation translation services. Given that computers are not able to translate effectively, i.e, with a translation that makes sense, users can do the translation themselves which will be used by other users to learn a new language.
					Crowdsourcing can also take a more complex form such as identify a tumor inside an X-ray film for radiology purpose. Indeed machine vision algorithms in this area cannot yet be totally reliable. Users can start with images that are easy to categorize and then progressively handle more complex situations as they prove they have some level of proficiency. This learning-by-learning approach can prove very efficient in the study/research area and can have a revolutionary impact on future education and work.</p>

					<h4>AI training and algorithm development</h4>
					<p>Finally human-intelligence may help develop artificial intelligence. Indeed, computer understanding of human language has always been a very difficult limit to break. Understanding a language is not only about speech recognition but also grammar, context, pragmatics, etc. A well-known example is that AI cannot tell the true meaning of «The book cannot fit the suitcase because it is too small.”</p>
