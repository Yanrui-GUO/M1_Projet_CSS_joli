					<p>How can benefit from Crowdsourcing ?</p> 
				</div> 
				
				<div id="intro">
					<p>“Mass collaboration is the future of competitive advantage in business.”  – Nick Wright,Crowdicity.</p><br>
					<p>Crowdsourcing defines the process of giving a special task to a large group of people, a crowd, instead of having it done within a company or a specific person. Although the term crowdsourcing has been created in 2006 by Jeff Howe, writer at Wired, as a combination of crowd and outsourcing, the concept isn’t new. Indeed, back in the nineteenth century, the Oxford English Dictionary was created by the crowd who would participate in the making of the dictionary by submitting definitions of words. Although it took 70 years to finish, the results were astonishing:  414,825 precise definitions were produced.</p>

					<h4> Benefits of crowdsourcing human intelligence  </h4>

					<h4> Impact of social aspect </h4>
					<p> The company who crowdsource micro-tasks and those who complete the task are not bound to each other by a contract of employment. This status, which is not ruled by any legislation, is therefore synonymous with flexibility for the average worker who would like to make an additional income from it. Flexibility comes from the ability to choose preferred tasks without being forced and from the ability to quit a task at any time.</p>
					<h4> Impact of economic aspect </h4>
					<p> Workers have no guarantee of getting paid and it has been reported that micro-task completion earnings were very low. Indeed, according to the American institute Pew Research Center, “nearly two-thirds of the jobs offered on Mturk are paid less than 10 cents”. Furthermore, according to Business Insider France, Amazon has increased its commissions by 20% or 40% when requesters need more than 10 people.</p>
					<h4> Ethical limitations  </h4>
					<p> Crowdsourcing can be used for not-for-profit organization or profit-orientated business. The latter is often source of ethical concerns because a company will generally use crowdsourcing to reduce its cost. The problem comes from the fact that, as previously said, it pays workers a really small fee and can benefit hugely from it.</p>
